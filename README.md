# 🧱 LEGO Data Exploration with Rebrickable

## Introduction

This project dives into the colorful world of LEGO using real-world data from [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/), a comprehensive site that catalogs every official LEGO set, theme, and part ever released.

We use Python and data analysis techniques to uncover fascinating insights about LEGO's history, growth, and strategy over time.
